<meta name="description" content="Appserver Environment &nbsp;provides a foundation for a flexible and extensible application infrastructure. OpenEdge Application Server supports an open, component-based model for partitioning applications, allowing them to be transformed into modular elements within an integrated environment.This enables business logic to be easily distributed and reused, saving time and resources. By partitioning applications and separating the business-processing logic from the user-interface logic, applications can be made available to users through virtually any interface. Centralized business logic offers a single point to manage access to data and processes for improved productivity.Appserver Architecture would look like belowAppServer Agents &nbsp;&nbsp;A process that executes remote procedure requests in the context of an OpenEdge session.
