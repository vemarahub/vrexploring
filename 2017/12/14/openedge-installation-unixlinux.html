<b>Installation Steps for Progress OpenEdge Product:</b><br />
<br />
Pre-requisite: DBA to make sure Java and apache already installed and we have progress Setup(installation pack), Root access <br />
Login to server and switch to root user, you always should be in /tmp directory to install the progress Open edge.<br />
<br />
~#cd /tmp<br />

<br />
when you hit above command you will be directed to below screen where it check the JVM and lets you select the required version.<br />
<br />
It is must that JVM should be installed in your machine where you going to install progress Open-edge, usually progress consultants will always prefer java 1.5 for 10.2b and 1.6 above for 11.x.<br />
<br />
You can check which java version is installed in your server by hitting command java -version.<br />
