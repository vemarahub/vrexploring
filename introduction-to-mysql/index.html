It provides multi-user access to support many storage engines and is backed by Oracle. So, you can buy a commercial license version from Oracle to get premium support services.The features of MySQL database are as follows:Ease of Management – The software very easily gets downloaded and also uses an event scheduler to schedule the tasks automatically. &lt;div&gt; Robust Transactional Support – Holds the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) property, and also allows distributed multi-version support. &lt;/div&gt; &nbsp; Comprehensive Application Development – MySQL has plugin libraries to embed the database into any application. It also supports stored procedures, triggers, functions, views and many more for application development.&nbsp; &nbsp; High Performance – Provides fast load utilities with distinct memory caches and table index partitioning.&nbsp; Low Total Cost Of Ownership – This reduces licensing costs and hardware expenditures. Open Source &amp; 24 * 7 Support – This RDBMS can be used on any platform and offers 24*7 support for open source and enterprise edition.&nbsp; Secure Data Protection – MySQL supports powerful mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have access to the databases.&nbsp; High Availability – MySQL can run high-speed master/slave replication configurations and it offers cluster servers.&nbsp; Scalability &amp; Flexibility – With MySQL you can run deeply embedded applications and create data warehouses holding a humongous amount of data." />
