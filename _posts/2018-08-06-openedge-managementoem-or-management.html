In windows version of progress openedge, the product package comes with an extra product which is not available in unix version of the openedge products - "OpenEdge Mgt. SE"<br />
<br />
This product is the Openedge Management Console, previously known as Openedge Explorer in previous OE versions.<br />
<br />
The OpenEdge management console or OEM is a browser based tool provided by progress to maintain and monitor the various openedge resources like database, admin server, appserver , nameserver etc through the&nbsp; tool.The tool also provides additional monitoring of the disk / memory usage of the server in which the openedge packages are installed and running.<br />
<br />
As compared to unix, where a DBA has to depend on shell scripting or other 3rd party tools to monitor the database and its resources, in windows progress provides a brilliant feature which makes the tasks of a DBA much easier and provides to even a non DBA to be able to perform database activities.<br />
<br />
The OEM can be accessed by hitting the URL : http://localhost:9090 or http://&lt;local_ipaddresss&gt;:9090 after starting the admin server.<br />
<br />
The OEM uses a default databases known as fathom database to capture all the statistics required for the OEM to function.<br />
<br />
The OEM can also be accessed through start menu by the name "Management Console".The login screen will look as below:<br />

<br />
The default user credential for management console is :"admin/admin"<br />
<br />
At first login, we have to reset the password for the OEM and provide some basic configurations like SMTP host ,port etc for the OEM tool.<br />
