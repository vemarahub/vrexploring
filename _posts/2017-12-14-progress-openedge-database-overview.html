This blog will walk you through the Progress OpenEdge Database basics and  help you get an idea you need essentially to become a Progress Database Administrator.<br /><br /><b>Brief History:</b><br /><br />Before moving into the technical aspect of the database system.Little insight about the origin of the company Progress whose product is the mighty Openedge (OE) database.<br /><br /> 1981 - Data Language Corporation (DLC) was formed  primarily working in application development and deployment tools.<br /><br />1984 - Relational Data Language product renamed “Progress”; first release for UNIX and DOS<br /><br /> 1987- Company renamed Progress Software Corporation.<br /><br />Some other popular products which Progress Software Corporation has in market other than Openedge include Telerik Platform(for mobile app development),Corticon(Rule Engine),Data Direct Connectors(connectivity between data sources),Rollbase(SaaS app development tool) etc.<br /><br /><b> Openedge Product Package:</b><br /><br />The below image would give a vague idea about different components which comes as part of the Openedge Product when you buy it from Progress for your business requirement.<br /><br /><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDQjWJaTjSYHEmnQluyw_VStwF2giQmBrFugfmRk2EFKCm9YnYCL6Tm90B9H-7WvUwjaHNfPLCnU2WUrP_Sc3HyV7UI8u1Zer3wRcxe8D29SdvXgewP4rmqCV-cGVL2APKusylRN2rP1rs/s1600/OE1.PNG"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDQjWJaTjSYHEmnQluyw_VStwF2giQmBrFugfmRk2EFKCm9YnYCL6Tm90B9H-7WvUwjaHNfPLCnU2WUrP_Sc3HyV7UI8u1Zer3wRcxe8D29SdvXgewP4rmqCV-cGVL2APKusylRN2rP1rs/s640/OE1.PNG" /></a><br /><br /><br /><b>The Main Components of Openedge Package would include:</b><br /><br />Advanced Business Language (ABL): Also know as Progress 4GL, it's a  modern hybrid procedural/object-oriented language, specifically designed for developing enterprise-class business applications.<br />Application Server:Integrated environment, including Web Server, Application Server and Adapters, for deploying and running server-based business applications.<br />RDBMS, Replication, Data Server: Scalable, reliable, secure ,multi-tenant database, management and monitoring tools.We would be dealing more with this layer as a Progress DBA.<br /><br /><b>Openedge Liscences:</b><br /><br />When you buy a Openedge product from Progress Software you can customize your shopping on the basis of the components you require or the number of users which are going to use the product.This will would help you in effectively costing your purchase of Openedge.<br /><br />To serve the same purpose Openedge provides different licences you can buy as per requirement.Some of the key licences are:<br /><br /><div>
1. 4GL Development System/OE Architect(for windows)<br /><br />2. OE workgroup RDBMS<br /><br />3. OE Application Svr Ent<br /><br />4. OE Replication/ Replication Plus<br /><br /><b>Openedge Versions:</b><br /><br />Progress Software has released different versions of the Openedge product in the span of all these years, latest being version 12.From experience i would say,for now 10.2B version is considered as most stable version and probably most widely used too.</div>

2019 12.0<br /><br /><br /><b> Openedge Database : RDBMS </b><br /><br /> Openedge database system is basically a relational database management system (RDBMS).<br /><br />A relational database is nothing but a  collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.<br /><br />This model organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called records or tuples.<br /><br />Generally, each table/relation represents one "entity type" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as "Lee" or "chair") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).<br /><br />Other DB examples of RDBMS would include Oracle,My SQL,DB2,Postgres etc.<br /></div>
