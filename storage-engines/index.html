Storage Engine determines data file format &amp; format of
indexes and are key to performance for the mongo database.It is the middletier between the database and the underlying hardware.</div>
&nbsp; <br />
A storage engine effects:<br />
* How data is written to disk<br />
*How data is deleted/removed from disk<br />
*How data is read from disk<br />
* The data structure used to store data<br />
<br />
From mongo 3.0 we can choose from two storage engines:<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
MMAPv1 and WiredTiger(opensource &amp; is used in other DBs)<o:p></o:p></div>
<b><br /></b>

•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Grew from original Storage Engine &amp; Uses unix MMAP system call<br />
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Maps data files directly into virtual memory<br />
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>mongod –storageEngine mmapv1 (we can check the storage engine using db.serverStatus())<br />
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Collection level locking with Mongo 3.0<br />
<div>
<div>
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Multiple reader and single writer lock on shared resources like data,metadata,index , journals etc in mongo db<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<b>MMAPv1:Documents &amp; Data Files</b></div>
<div>

<div>
Within data files, different extents would be present to hold the documents.</div>

<div>
If D2 grows, it has to move after D4 leaving space in D2, we also have to update indexes( to update address of D2)</div>
<div>
Power of 2 sized allocation(padding factor is true by default):document is first given 32bytes, then 64,128..2 MB to grow</div>
<div>
Advantage of MMAPv1 padding and power of 2 sized allocation is:</div>
<div>
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Documents will not have to move as soon as they grow in size</div>
<div>
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Record spaces are likely to get re-used</div>
<div>
•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Documents that grow at a constant rate will move less often as time goes on.&nbsp;</div>
