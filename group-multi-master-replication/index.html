Group multi master replication is a master-master replication setup in MySQL.<br />
Follow the below steps to configure group multi replication:<br />
<br />
1.Considering 3 servers in the group multi master replication, install mysql-community-server on all the 3 servers.<br />
<br />
2.Consider one of the server to be the bootstrap server .<br />
<br />
3.Run uuidgen command on the bootstrap server to generate a hexadecimal unique key:<br />
<b>uuidgen</b><br />
<b>5c200097-3e7e-4616-a045-25e871df7cb6</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
4.Add the below entry in /etc/my.cnf file of all the 3 servers to be configured:<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b># General replication settings</b><br />
<b>gtid_mode = ON</b><br />
<b>enforce_gtid_consistency = ON</b><br />
<b>master_info_repository = TABLE</b><br />
<b>relay_log_info_repository = TABLE</b><br />
<b>binlog_checksum = NONE</b><br />
<b>log_slave_updates = ON</b><br />
<b>log_bin = binlog</b><br />
<b>binlog_format = ROW</b><br />
<b>transaction_write_set_extraction = XXHASH64</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_bootstrap_group = OFF</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_start_on_boot = OFF</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_ssl_mode = REQUIRED</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_recovery_use_ssl = 1</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
<b><br /></b>
<b># Single or Multi-primary mode? Uncomment these two lines</b><br />
<b># for multi-primary mode, where any host can accept writes</b><br />
<b>#loose-group_replication_single_primary_mode = OFF</b><br />
<b>#loose-group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks = ON</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
5. Add below entry in /etc/my.cnf file with replication_group_name as the uuid generated in<br />
step 3.Also add ip addresses of all the three servers involved ip ip_whitelist and group_seeds entry<br />
<b># Shared replication group configuration</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_group_name = "5c200097-3e7e-4616-a045-25e871df7cb6"</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_ip_whitelist = "192.168.197.131,192.168.197.130,192.168.197.129"</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_group_seeds = "192.168.197.131:33061,192.168.197.130:33061,192.168.197.129:33061"</b><br />
<br />
6.Add ip address of each server specifically for the below entries and provide a seperate server_id for each<br />
<b># Host specific replication configuration</b><br />
<b>server_id=1</b><br />
<b>bind-address = "192.168.197.131"</b><br />
<b>report_host = "192.168.197.131"</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_local_address = "192.168.197.131:33061"</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
7. After adding all the entries, do a restart of mysqld<br />
<b>systemctl restart mysqld</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
8.On the all three nodes run the below queries on MySQL prompt:<br />
<b>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;</b><br />
<b>CREATE USER 'repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '!@#Ilg007' REQUIRE SSL;</b><br />
<b>GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%';</b><br />
<b>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</b><br />
<b>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
9.Also, run the below statement on all three nodes to enable the created user for replication for channel group replication recovery<br />
<b>change master to master_user='repl',master_password='!@#Ilg007' for channel 'group_replication_recovery';</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
10.Install group_replication plugin on all three nodes<br />
<b>Install plugin group_replication soname 'group_replication.so';</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
11.Check if the plugin is active<br />
<b>show plugins</b><br />
<br />
12.We would require SSL support for group replication, so first check on the bootstrap node if ssl is available<br />
<b>show variables like "%ssl%"; or \s</b><br />
<br />
13.If ssl is disabled , we can install the ssl using mysql_ssl_rsa_setup utility on the bootstrap node<br />
<b>mysql_ssl_rsa_setup --uid=mysql</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
<br />
14.Confirm if ssl has been installed correctly by checking for .pem extention files in /var/lib/mysql and restart mysqld to make the ssl change in effect.<br />
<br />
15.Now that the configuration setup is completed for all the nodes, start the group replication on the bootstrap node first as below<br />
<b>set global group_replication_bootstrap_group=ON;</b><br />
<b>start group_replication;</b><br />
<b>set global group_replication_bootstrap_group=OFF;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
16. Now if we check the below query, we would be able to see our bootstrap node as online in the query result<br />
<b>select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
17.In the other two nodes, simply start the group replication<br />
<b>start group_replication;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
18. Now if we check the query on step 16 on any of the nodes, we would be able to see all the three nodes as online in the query result.<br />
<b>select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
19.Now the multi replication setup is completed, we can try adding data in bootstrap node and check if it is getting replicated in other two nodes.<br />
<br />
20.By any chance , if any of the nodes is not listed in the step 18 query or is in recovery mode, check logs /var/log/mysqld.log for any possible errors.<br />
<br />
21.One of the common error is of data in any of the nodes being greater than that of bootstrap node, follow the below steps to rectify such errors:<br />
&nbsp;a. On all three nodes run the below command<br />
<b>SELECT @@global.gtid_executed;</b><br />
<br />
b.Check for any missing GTID in bootstrap which are present in other two nodes<br />
<br />
c.load those GTIDs in bootstrap node on by one<br />
<b>SET GTID_NEXT='a1c5e25e-2715-11e7-bbe4-0800273fb9a2:1';</b><br />
<b>begin;</b><br />
<b>commit;</b><br />
<b>SET GTID_NEXT='a1c5e25e-2715-11e7-bbe4-0800273fb9a2:2';</b><br />
<b>begin;</b><br />
<b>commit;</b><br />
<b>SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';</b><br />
<br />
d. Now run start group replication on the failed nodes<br />
<b>start group_replication;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
e.Check again if all nodes are online<br />
<b>select * from performance_schema.replication_group_members;</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
22. For enabling multi write in the multi group replication, uncomment the following lines in /etc/my.cnf file and restart the group replication<br />
<b>loose-group_replication_single_primary_mode = OFF</b><br />
<b>loose-group_replication_enforce_update_everywhere_checks = ON</b><br />
