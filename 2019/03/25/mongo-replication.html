Replication in any database is critical for setting up a secondary instance for the database instance.In mongo replication serves the purpose of :<br />
* HA - High Availablity on a failover<br />
*Durability - Data safety of our primary database instance<br />
* Maintaining extra copies of the critical database<br />
*DR - Having a setup of disaster recovery to help in case of loss of servers/drives in case of some unseen disasters like natural calamities.<br />
<br />
The database replication setup in Mongo is asynchronous i.e. there is&nbsp; latency for writing from master to slave databases.Also for mongo we can have single primary with multiple slave setups.<br />
<br />
Replication Cluster : Primary and set of secondaries are together called as cluster and the instances part of this clusters are called&nbsp; as members of set<br />
<br />
Replication Factor: This refers to the number of members in sets including primary and secondaries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Replication can be:<br />
<br />
* Statement Based :&nbsp; Each CRUD operation would be replicated to the slave databases in the replication setup statement by statement.<br />
<br />
* Binary Based: The binary corresponding to each transaction would be replicated to target databases in this case.<br />
<br />
<b>Automatic Failover</b><br />
Mongo has automatic failover and automatic node recovery when a member of replica set fails.Mongo uses consensus / majority notion to determine when primary is down.<br />
The mongo driver is replica set aware , so when one of the members of the replica set goes down one of the active member is elected as primary and application starts using that node.<br />

Recommendation For Replica Sets</h3>
<div>
<div>
1 data Center:</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3 members</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2 + 1 arbiter</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2 with manual failover</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
-3 members with 1 small server as secondary, we can keep priority 0 for that .</div>
<div>
Multiple data center:</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3 members</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2 in one DC1, one secondary in DC2</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Make priority 0 for DC2</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3 members</div>
<div>
-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Each in DC1, DC2 and DC3</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Limit per set : &lt;= 12 members and &lt;= 7 voters</div>
<div>
<br />
Replication sends operations from primary , not bytes – thus storage engine doesn’t affect.Thus different members in the replica set can have different storage engines.<br />
