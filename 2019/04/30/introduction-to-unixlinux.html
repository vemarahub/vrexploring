<b>How does the Linux OS work?</b></h3>
<b><br /></b>
Linux has a KERNEL and one or more SHELLS<br />
The shell is the command line interface through which the user interacts with the OS (Kernel). Most commonly used shell is “bash”<br />
The Kernel sits on top of the hardware and is the core of the OS; it receives tasks from the Shell, do some actions and display the result back to user session.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<div>
When we connect to Linux machine (using putty tool etc,), shell prompt displays, where commands are executed.</div>
<div>
Eg.</div>
<div>
<i>[training@Standalone2 ~]$</i></div>
<div>
<i>training is the username , Standalone2 is the hostname ( this shell prompt is customizable #echo $PS1)</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Each user has a home dir (Ex . /home/training). It has a profile file (Ex .bash_profile for bash shell) (depends on your default shell used while creating the user).. Different shells are bash,ksh,csh etc. .bash_profile (or other profile) file is executed when the user logs in . it contains settings specific to the user. You can add you environment variables or settings into this file. /etc/profile is the generic profile which is executed first for all users.</div>
<div>
Root user is the superuser, which has special privileges . This is generally held by the system admins (for shutdown/reboot, install packages , user creation, Job scheduling etc.,)</div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<br />Linux File System&nbsp;</h3>
<div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
•A directory in Linux is similar to a “Folder” in Windows OS&nbsp;</div>
<div>
•Files are organized into directories and sub-directories&nbsp;</div>
<div>
•In Linux, paths begin at the root directory which is the top-level of the file system and is represented as a forward slash ( / )&nbsp;</div>
<div>
•Forward slash is used to separate directory and file names&nbsp;</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<i>[training@Standalone2 /]$ ls</i></div>
<div>
<i>bin&nbsp; &nbsp;cgroup&nbsp; etc&nbsp; &nbsp;lib&nbsp; &nbsp; lost+found&nbsp; misc&nbsp; net&nbsp; proc&nbsp; sbin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;srv&nbsp; tmp&nbsp; var</i></div>
