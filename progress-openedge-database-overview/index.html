2019 12.0<br /><br /><br /><b> Openedge Database : RDBMS </b><br /><br /> Openedge database system is basically a relational database management system (RDBMS).<br /><br />A relational database is nothing but a  collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.<br /><br />This model organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called records or tuples.<br /><br />Generally, each table/relation represents one "entity type" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as "Lee" or "chair") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).<br /><br />Other DB examples of RDBMS would include Oracle,My SQL,DB2,Postgres etc.<br /></div>
